Repository for homework lesson 4 with additional tasks
# Homework0
Create an array of integers. Write a program that outputs a message whether the given number is included in the array or not.
Let the number to be searched be specified from the console (class Scanner).
# Homework1
Create an array of integers. Remove all occurrences of a given
number from the array. Let the number be specified from the console (class Scanner). If there is no such number, print a message about it.
The result should be a new array without the specified number.
# Homework2 
Create and fill an array with a random number and output the
the maximum, minimum, and average value.
Use the Math.random() method to generate a random number.
Let it be possible to create an array of arbitrary size. Let the array size be entered from the console.
# Homework3
Create 2 arrays of 5 numbers.
Print the arrays to the console in two separate lines.
Calculate the arithmetic mean of the elements of each array and print a message for which of the arrays this value is greater (or print a message that their arithmetic averages are equal).
# AdditionalTask0
Create an array of n random integers and display it on the screen.
The array size is set from the console and the array size can be greater than 5 and less than or equal to 10.
If n does not satisfy the condition, print a message about it.
If the user has entered a wrong number, the program should ask the user to repeat the input.
Create a second array of only even elements of the first array, if any, and display it on the screen.
# AdditionalTask1
Create and fill an array.
Display the array on the screen as a string.
Replace each element with an odd index with zero.
Display the array again on the screen on a separate line.
# AdditionalTask2
Create an array of strings.
Fill it with arbitrary names of people.
Sort the array and output the result to the console.
# AdditionalTask3
Implementation of the bubble sorting algorithm.
